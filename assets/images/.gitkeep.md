# Images

This folder contains general images used throughout the application.

## Guidelines

- Use appropriate formats: PNG for images with transparency, JPG for photos
- Optimize file sizes for web performance
- Use descriptive filenames
- Consider providing multiple resolutions for responsive design

## Organization

You can further organize images by:

- Creating subfolders by feature/screen
- Grouping by image type (photos, illustrations, backgrounds)
- Separating by platform if needed
