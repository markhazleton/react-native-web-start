## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### 📧 Private Disclosure

For security vulnerabilities, please **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue. Instead, please report security vulnerabilities privately to ensure responsible disclosure.

**Contact Methods:**
- **Email**: [markh@markhazleton.com](mailto:markh@markhazleton.com)
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] React Native Web Starter - [Brief Description]`

### 📋 What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** assessment
4. **Affected versions** or components
5. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
6. **Your contact information** for follow-up

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### 🏆 Security Researchers

We appreciate the security research community and will:

- **Acknowledge** your contribution (with your permission)
- **Provide updates** on our progress
- **Credit you** in our security advisories
- **Work with you** on responsible disclosure

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. **Use HTTPS** for all API communications
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
4. **Implement proper authentication** for sensitive features
5. **Review third-party packages** before adding them

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Sanitize user inputs** to prevent XSS
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing sensitive information
5. **Follow OWASP guidelines** for web security

## 🔍 Security Measures

### Dependency Management

- **Dependabot** automatically monitors and updates dependencies
- **npm audit** runs regularly to identify vulnerabilities
- **Security patches** are prioritized and released quickly

### Code Security

- **TypeScript strict mode** helps catch potential issues
- **ESLint security rules** identify common security problems
- **Code review process** includes security considerations

### Build & Deployment

- **GitHub Actions** with secure workflows
- **No secrets in repository** - all sensitive data via environment variables
- **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline

## 📊 Known Security Considerations

### Web Platform

- **Content Security Policy** implementation recommended
- **XSS protection** through input validation
- **HTTPS enforcement** for production deployments

### Mobile Platforms

- **Code obfuscation** for production builds
- **Certificate pinning** for API communications
- **Secure storage** for sensitive data

### Dependencies

We regularly monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- **React Native**: Following React Native security guidelines
- **Vite**: Using latest secure version with security features enabled
- **Third-party packages**: Regular audits and updates
